{"name":"Zenko","type":"ancestry","effects":[],"system":{"description":{"gm":"","value":"<p>It's unknown what makes foxes so appealing to both mortals and the divine. However, regardless of the fascination, fox folk have existed within fiction and even fiction within the fiction. In most fantasy worlds, there exists a race of creatures called Kitsune, which possess two forms, an attractive humanoid form, and a furry true form. These are exceptionally well designed races, but they are slightly mundane compared to the powers and abilities of their country of origin. The Zenko are as close to the original spiritual creature as our games can get.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Divine Fox Folk</h2>\n<p>Unlike the humanoid tribes of the Kitsune, the Zenko are true fox spirits. However, rather being incorporeal as ghosts, they're closer to fey being physical creatures with magical nature powers. Much like the Kitsune tribes, Zenko also have two forms. They can disguise or transform into beautiful humanoids with fox-like features such as ears, tails, paws, and sometimes claws. The true form of the Zenko are their fox-spirit forms, which appear to be exactly like their animal counterparts, but with distinct supernatural differences such as pure white fur, being surrounded by ghostly fire, and sometimes, multiple tails.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Sent With A Purpose</h2>\n<p>Nearly all Zenko are sent to the material plane by a divine god in order to complete some sort of mission. Sometimes, the mission is as big and important as a world saving quest, while other times it is to be the house maid of a loyal mortal whose stress is causing evil spirits to manifest in their household. Thus, most Zenko are friendly, helpful, and loving.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>From The Realm Of Gods</h2>\n<p>Zenko come from a special realm within the ethereal plane that is managed by the god of rice, commerce, and great fortune. Zenko serve as their messengers, assistants, and crusaders. While gods have very strict rules when they can intervene and perform miracles of great power, the Zenko are under no such restrictions and can perform tasks to the best of their abilities. Depending on the age of the Zenko, they may simply be as strong as the average mortal or just shy of a deity themselves.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>A Divine Quest For Power</h2>\n<p>Nearly every adventuring Zenko is on a direct mission from their god. While some may simply wander and leave for their own amusement, the vast majority of these rarely seen creatures do so with a mission. As they adventure and become stronger they grow additional tails that grant them more wisdom, power, and (as a result) courage.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>The Age Old Question</h2>\n<p>Much like dragons, Zenko grow in power as they age, but very slowly. It takes nearly 1000 years for a Zenko to fully mature. As they age, they gain greater titles. These titles are listed as such:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fox Spirit. 50 years old. Technically any fox (or the race known as Kitsune) can reach the rank of spirit fox. If any fox in the multiverse reaches the age of 50, they can regain their youth and learn to transform into humanoids and begin their training as divine servants.</li>\n<li>Kiko. Also ccalled Energy Fox. After 500 years of service, Kitsune become proper divine messengers and begin to perform assignments. When a spirit fox reaches this age, their fur changes colors and they become one of the following subtypes.\n<ul>\n<li>Byakko - White Fox.</li>\n<li>Kinko - Sun Fox.</li>\n<li>Kokuko - Moon Fox.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Myoubu -A member of the Imperial Court. There is no distinct age at which a Zenko earns this title. However, their powers have significantly increased and they are able to assign jobs to Kiko foxes and doll out blessings to loyal mortals.</li>\n<li>Tenko - The Heavenly Fox. After a millennium of experience, a Myoubu is capable of becoming a demigod-like creature called a Tenko. These Zenko sprout 4 tails (but can grow up to 9), and are capable of granting divine spells, and gain the power of clairvoyance, able to correctly predict the future.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Zenko Names</h2>\n<p>The Zenko have similar naming conventions to the Kitsune and other creatures inspired by their home country of inspiration. Their names are multisyllabic and usually have special meanings.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names</strong>: Gonobu, Daisuki, Jushushu, Gikoto, Yori, Daichi, Yotada, Homoru, Kei, Nobuyuki.</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names</strong>: Kaetomo, Hisoko, Chiromi, Masami, Etsuko, Aimi, Reiko, Kasumi, Masako.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Physiology and Philosophy</h2>\n<p>Zenko are otherworldly celestial fey. And as such have unique biological quirks that defy common explanation.</p>\n<p><strong>    Age</strong>. A Zenko matures into an adult humanoid body at 50 years old (assuming they evolved from a fox), but is not considered an \"adult\" or ready for adventure and proper assignments until around 500 years old. Details are further available in \"The Age Old Question\" section.</p>\n<p><strong>    Alignment</strong>. Zenko are servants of a kind and generous god of commerce. As such, they tend to be one of the good alignments. Zenko that stray from this path are no longer considered as such and are called Yako or \"trickster foxes\".</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"rules":[],"slug":"zenko","schema":{"version":0.84,"lastMigration":null},"traits":{"value":["celestial","fey","hb_zenko"],"rarity":"uncommon"},"hp":8,"size":"med","reach":5,"speed":25,"boosts":{"0":{"value":["cha"]},"1":{"value":[]},"2":{"value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]}},"flaws":{"0":{"value":[]}},"languages":{"value":["celestial","common","sylvan"],"custom":""},"additionalLanguages":{"count":0,"value":[],"custom":""},"items":{"yhuLm":{"uuid":"Item.3cPcfzyFCudQVg8Q","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/fey-disapperance.webp","name":"Change Shape (Zenko)","level":0}},"vision":"lowLightVision"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/ancestry.svg","ownership":{"default":0,"XV70kTufyit7bW3z":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.3IdrIf6ohBXHHBsc"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.12.9","coreVersion":"10.310","createdTime":1703143599958,"modifiedTime":1703318748587,"lastModifiedBy":"XV70kTufyit7bW3z"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"6wd1X87WNF3V1LGT"}
{"name":"Yurei","type":"ancestry","effects":[],"system":{"description":{"gm":"","value":"<p>There are many ghost stories of vengeful spirits returning from beyond the grave to enact revenge upon those that wronged them. But what happened to the spirits who love their partners and family so much that they stick around to share their life and their afterlives with them?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Floating Shimmer</h2>\n<p>As ghosts Yurei are the spiritual remains of a once living person. They retain the same size and movement speed of their race when they were once alive. Yurei however give off an unsettling and ghostly aura. They float in place and often wear clothing they would have had for their funeral regardless of whether or not they died in them. They have a pale translucent appearance and piercing eyes that unsettle many.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Bound By Love</h2>\n<p>A Yurei keeps the morals and values they had when they were alive. The only exception and change to their behavior is possibly their devotion to their loves, which literally allowed them to transcend back to the mortal planes. This devotion can be twisted into an unhealthy obsession and can cause even further heartache for themselves and the subjects of their affection.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Heart And Home</h2>\n<p>A yurei is bound to a person, almost always the object of their affection, a symbol of their undying love, or the place they consider home. As such, there is no centralized Yurei society. While many find their devotions to their love admirable, most believe that Yurei should be exorcised and be allowed to move on and find peace in the afterlife.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Not Ready To Move On</h2>\n<p>Yurei adventurers are individuals who felt they haven't spent enough time with those they love and stick around to keep their loved one safe. Due to the dangers of adventuring, there is a chance that their love may join them. Some adventuring couples do manage to make it work, but this is incredibly rare.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Yurei Names</h2>\n<p>Yurei keep the names and identities they had when they were alive. When choosing what character you were in life, select a name that would be most appropriate for that race.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Physiology and Philosophy</h2>\n<p>Yurei are manifestations of spirits from beyond the grave. As such, their ghostly bodies and their mentality are affected by this unlife. Lifespan. Although technically irrelevant at this point since a Yurei is already dead, Yurei retain the same physical and mental age of the day they died. Though they are capable of learning and changing over the course of their unlife. A yurei remains in the mortal planes until they are exorcised or until they are ready to move on. Alignment. Yurei tend to have the same alignment they had when they died. However, due to the nature of undead and their means of tying themselves to the mortal world they tend to start gravitating towards the chaotic and evil sides of the alignment spectrum the longer they remain. Subrace. Yurei do not have subraces, instead they come back as a type of spirit associated with their cause of death. See Cause of Death below for the Yurei types you can return as.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Cause of Death</h2>\n<p>When playing a Yurei, you must choose a race to have been while alive. You gain that race's language and any other non-mechanical benefits they would have. Not only that, you and your GM should determine your cause of death. This cause of death determines your subtype of Yurei when you return to unlife. A yurei character becomes one of the following subtypes:</p>\n<h3>Funayurei</h3>\n<p>The ghosts of those that died at sea. They sometimes have fish-like traits. These Yurei tend to have an unpleasant fishy smell about them.</p>\n<h3>Fuyurei</h3>\n<p>Floating gaseous spirits. Believed to cause and spread diseases. Fuyurei don't have legs but instead hover above the ground. Eerie the ghost, the Yurei avatar on the previous page is a Fuyurei.</p>\n<h3>Jibakurei</h3>\n<p>Earthbound spirits that are instead bound to a person, place, or object and grounding you to reality easier. Jibakurei tend to be more mentally and physically stable than other Yurei.</p>\n<h3>Onryo</h3>\n<p>An Onryo is a vengeful spirit who return from purgatory to haunt those that wronged them (often times their own families). These ghosts tend to be evil and stalk their murderers like revenants.</p>\n<h3>Ubume</h3>\n<p>A mother ghost who died in childbirth. This ghost returns to take care of her children, often bringing sweets.</p>\n<h3>Zashiki-Warashi</h3>\n<p>The ghosts of children; often mischievous (and obviously less motivated by love and obsession). If you choose this subtype, you will be playing as a dead child character</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"rules":[],"slug":"yurei","schema":{"version":0.84,"lastMigration":null},"traits":{"value":["ghost","spirit","undead","hb_yurei"],"rarity":"rare"},"hp":8,"size":"med","reach":5,"speed":25,"boosts":{"0":{"value":["wis"]},"1":{"value":[]},"2":{"value":["cha","con","dex","int","str","wis"]}},"flaws":{"0":{"value":[]}},"languages":{"value":["common","necril"],"custom":""},"additionalLanguages":{"count":0,"value":[],"custom":""},"items":{"srhay":{"uuid":"Item.5k1PkHb2u7TTx227","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Even in Death","level":0}},"vision":"normal"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/ancestry.svg","ownership":{"default":0,"XV70kTufyit7bW3z":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.zW6hAKC67sqFN80W"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.12.9","coreVersion":"10.310","createdTime":1703143570378,"modifiedTime":1703318746931,"lastModifiedBy":"XV70kTufyit7bW3z"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"XuVoWBougBMSO2Qi"}
{"name":"Divine Dragon","type":"ancestry","effects":[],"system":{"description":{"gm":"","value":"<p>Immortality: Many races and creatures wish for it, but few of them truly understand the sadness it brings. While to many, the world is eternal and never-ending, the Divine Dragons are one of the few races that can see and watch as their planets age. Awakening when they are needed, and sleeping in times of peace, the Divine Dragons are creatures with endless love in their hearts, but with almost no one they can share it with.</p>\n<h2>Large and Impossible</h2>\n<p>The true form of the Divine Dragons are that of a colossal scaleless wyrm. Pale with patches in white fur, the Divine Dragons purposely reduce themselves to the power, size, and appearance of a masic. Although their attitude and personality often betray their disguises, they sometimes purposely allow themselves to have extra appendages such as wings, tails, or claws, simply in order to help themselves stay sane and keep their identity.</p>\n<h2>Endless kindness</h2>\n<p>Divine Dragons are built by the gods in order to serve as a counter-balancing force to world ending threats. As such, their hearts are filled with endless love for life. While adventuring with a good aligned party, they form powerful bonds that transcend time.</p>\n<h2>Rarely Seen, Endlessly Asleep</h2>\n<p>Divine Dragons are incredibly rare. It is likely that less than 10 ever exist on a world at any given time, and even less are ever active at once. Most of the time, they are sleeping, awaiting a time in which they are needed. Divine Dragons work well within a party, they tend to blend into a group just fine serving as supporting and loyal comrades.</p>\n<h2>Alone</h2>\n<p>Divine Dragons have no formal home, no formal people, or culture. They are simply created as guardians of a world by whichever deities are in charge. Sometimes mortals will create towns, communities, and entire cultures around a Divine Dragon, for a time, they can be quite happy and form great memories, due to the uncaring march of time, these civilizations eventually fall and the dragons return to slumber. Divine Dragons can find loving partners. Though, it is rare for them to have children. Even rarer are Divine Dragons who have children that inherit their great powers. The risk of outliving a true love and having a true family is too great and often too emotionally damaging for a Divine Dragon. It is not unheard of for Divine Dragons to slip into insanity and hatred for their nature and role. Eons of watching their friends and loved ones die is emotionally scarring and while the Divine Dragons are nigh unkillable when at their full power, they are still subject to their emotions. When this occurs a threat enters the world</p>\n<h2>Divine Dragon Names</h2>\n<p>Divine Dragons tend to adopt names given to them by mortals and keep these names for their entire immortal life. Due to their origins, they tend to be named after gods or their names are treated as akin to gods. Their names tend to be simple, limited to one or two syllables, but strong in concept.</p>\n<p><strong>Example Names:</strong> Ghoat, Naga, Xine, Taki, Milo, Dhoma, Bae, Aska, Idub, Morga, Emba, Aleer.</p>\n<h2>Physiology and Philosophy</h2>\n<p>Divine Dragons, as divine creations tend to have a unique biology.</p>\n<p>    <strong>Lifespan.</strong> Divine Dragons are technically ageless, their humanoid bodies can grow older like masics do if they choose. However, a Divine Dragon that is created by a god is \"born\" fully grown with a full adult form.</p>\n<p>    If a Divine Dragon is born or hatched through \"mortal means\" they need to age like any other earthborn creature. They reach mental and emotional maturity as fast as most masics, but their humanoid bodies tend to slow drastically once they become young teenagers. It can take up to several hundred years for them to begin looking like humanoid adults.</p>\n<p>    Divine Dragons tend to stay active for about 100 years before they enter a deep hibernation for around 500-3000 years.</p>\n<p>    <strong>Alignment.</strong> Nearly all Divine Dragons are good by their very nature. Individually, they decide to split between Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic. It is not unheard of for Divine Dragons to dip into other alignments. An evil Divine Dragon is known as a Demonic Dragon.</p>\n<p>    <strong>Subrace.</strong> Divine Dragons are technically a special type of dragon and celestial subrace.
